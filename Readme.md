# Hono Server with Drizzle ORM and PGLite (WASM PostgreSQL)

This repository contains a server application built using the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework, [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm), and [PGLite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite) (a WebAssembly build of PostgreSQL). The server is bundled into a single executable binary using [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg).

## Architecture Overview

### Components

1. **Hono Framework**: A lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js, designed for creating APIs and web applications.
2. **Drizzle ORM**: A TypeScript-first ORM for building type-safe SQL queries.
3. **PGLite**: A WebAssembly build of PostgreSQL, allowing you to run a lightweight database in a Node.js environment.
4. **pkg**: A tool for packaging Node.js projects into standalone executables.
5. **Prisma (Optional)**: using Prisma for database migrations and schema management.


### Data Flow

1. **API Requests**: Clients send HTTP requests to the Hono server.
2. **Drizzle ORM**: The server uses Drizzle ORM to interact with the PGLite database.
3. **PGLite (WASM PostgreSQL)**: PGLite handles the database operations, executing SQL queries and managing data.
4. **Response**: The server sends HTTP responses back to the client.

## Architecture Design

### Design Overview

The architecture leverages a combination of modern web frameworks, ORMs, and lightweight database solutions to create a robust and efficient server application. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Hono Framework**:
    
    - **Role**: Acts as the web server, handling HTTP requests and responses.
    - **Benefits**: Lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it ideal for building APIs.
2. **Drizzle ORM**:
    
    - **Role**: Manages database interactions, providing a type-safe way to write SQL queries.
    - **Benefits**: Ensures type safety and reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.
3. **PGLite (WASM PostgreSQL)**:
    
    - **Role**: Acts as the database engine, running as a WebAssembly module within the Node.js environment.
    - **Benefits**: Lightweight, portable, and does not require a separate database server, making it ideal for embedded applications.
4. **pkg**:
    
    - **Role**: Bundles the Node.js application into a standalone executable.
    - **Benefits**: Simplifies deployment and distribution by creating a single binary that can run on different platforms without requiring Node.js to be installed on the target machine.

### Pros

1. **Portability**: The use of PGLite and `pkg` makes the application highly portable, as it can be run on any platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) without additional dependencies.
2. **Simplicity**: The architecture is straightforward, with clear separation between the web framework, ORM, and database.
3. **Performance**: Hono and PGLite are designed to be lightweight and fast, providing efficient handling of requests and database operations.
4. **Type Safety**: Drizzle ORM ensures type safety, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving maintainability.

## Creating a Single Executable from a Node.js Server

### Using `pkg`

`pkg` is a tool that packages Node.js projects into standalone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux. This allows you to distribute a single binary that can be run on different platforms without requiring Node.js to be installed.

#### Tauri Sidecar

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is a framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. You can integrate the standalone executable created with `pkg` into a Tauri application using the Tauri sidecar feature. Tauri sidecar allows you to bundle and ship additional executables with your Tauri application. This is useful for including background services, helper processes, or other binaries that your application depends on. (Note: your bundled server increase final build size of Tauri app)
